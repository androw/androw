We decided to spend the night at Le Nant du Beurre, a refuge situated at an altitude of 2080 meters in the Bauges massif.\nWe made an appointment for a weekend in early March. After a few withdrawals, we settled on four participants: Léa, Aditi, Romuald and myself.\nVehicle # The trip was by train and car. We took the train from Paris to Albertville, where Léa picked us up by car.\nRoute # Day 1: Departure from Paris and ascent to the refuge # We left Paris early in the morning, arriving in Albertville around midday to buy sandwiches. This was followed by a 45-minute drive to the village of Grand Naves. From the parking lot, we took the shuttle bus up to the Tovet parking lot at an altitude of 1550 meters. From here, we put on our snowshoes and headed for the Nant du Beurre refuge.\nThe start of the climb The start of the trail was rather muddy, but we soon found snow. It took us about 3 hours to reach the refuge. This was a first for Aditi, and it showed on the last part of the climb.\nDay 2: Ascent to Pointe du Dzonfié (2455 m) # As Aditi wasn\u0026rsquo;t feeling too well (we found out later that she must have had the flu), we left her at the hut after a hearty breakfast.\nThe three of us then headed for the Pointe du Dzonfié. We weren\u0026rsquo;t sure what conditions we were going to find, but everything went very well.\nOn the ridge leading to the summit We returned to the refuge by a similar route, and reached it for lunch.\nOur group at Pointe du Dzonfié In the afternoon, we took a leisurely walk back down to the Tovet parking lot, where we caught the shuttle bus to the village of Grand Naves. We took the car to Valmorel, where we had booked a room. We took advantage of the evening to rent ski equipment and go to the restaurant.\nDay 3: Skiing in Valmorel # We started the day as soon as the slopes opened, to make the most of the day.\nOn the chairlift Aditi took her first ski lesson and made her first turns.\nIn the late afternoon, we headed back to Albertville to catch the train back to Paris.\nBudget # The refuge does not accept credit cards. It is therefore important to bring cash or a checkbook.\nThe cost of a night at the refuge on a half-board basis is €51 per person (remember to book in advance), plus €12 for a picnic. Snowshoe hire is also included.\nFor a day\u0026rsquo;s skiing, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to budget around €35 for equipment hire and €43 for the Grand Domaine ski pass if you book online.\nMusic # The size of the group and the joy of reunion left no room for music.\n","date":"6 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/posts/2025-nant-du-beurre/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Snowshoeing at Nant du Beurre","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/boat/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Boat","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/car/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Car","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/croatia/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Croatia","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/croatie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Croatie","type":"tags"},{"content":"My girlfriend and I decided to spend a week in Croatia this summer. For this first trip to the country, we chose to concentrate on the southern islands, which are relatively uncrowded.\nWe had booked our accommodation and flights online, but we hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet decided on our means of transport. We knew we\u0026rsquo;d be taking the boats, but we decided to rent a car on each of the islands.\nThere are few hotels on the islands. Our accommodations were independent apartment rentals.\nVehicle # We rented a car on each of the islands, notably from MiniBum in Mljet and Prizmic in Vela Luka (Korčula). An alternative solution would have been to rent a car in Dubrovnik, but this leaves less flexibility for the boats.\nRoute # Day 1: Evening departure from Paris, arrival in Dubrovnik # We had picked an accommodation close to the ferry port of Dubrovnik to be able to catch the boat early the next day.\nDay 2: Arrival on the island of Mljet, visit to the National Park, and Odysseus Cave (Odisejeva špilja) # Our boat got us to Mljet in the morning. We made the mistake of taking a cab to our accommodation, when we should have rented a car directly from the port.\nWe then headed for the National Park on the other side of the island for a walk. Entrance to the park includes a boat to a small island with a monastery.\nView from the monastery island We took advantage of the setting to swim a little, then took the boat back to Mali most, the bridge separating the small and large lakes. We then walked around the large lake. Make sure you bring plenty of water - it\u0026rsquo;s very hot!\nWe finally took a dip on the other side of the large lake, at the second bridge, where the lake water exchanges with the seawater, generating a natural current.\nAfter another car journey, we ended the day at the Odysseus cave, which consists of a chasm and a tunnel leading into the cave from the sea. The site also makes for great diving. The passage through the tunnel offers magnificent blue colors.\nDay 3: Visit to Saplunara and arrival on the island of Lastovo # We started the day with a stop at Prožurska Luka and Okuklje.\nView of the port of Prožurska Luka Before taking the boat in the early afternoon for the island of Lastovo, we went to enjoy Saplunara, with its sandy beach. It\u0026rsquo;s a busy place with lots of boats. We had lunch at the Franka restaurant, which serves traditional grilled meats on a shaded terrace overlooking the bay.\nAfter the boat ride, we collected our car and headed for our accommodation, which offered a superb panorama of Zaklopatica Bay. We ended the day by enjoying the sea just below our apartment.\nDay 4: Visit to former military sites, rest, and stars # We started the day by visiting Lastovo\u0026rsquo;s former military sites, including the submarine tunnels and Jurjev Vrh.\nOne of the tunnels used to hide a submarine After a quick lunch, we took advantage of the nearby lighthouse in the bay of Skrivena Luka for a swim. We also took a look at the nearby cliffs.\nThe cliffs of Skrivena Luka On the way back, we climbed up to Lastovo Castle, which can\u0026rsquo;t be visited, and headed down to see the bays of Lučica and Sveti Mihovil.\nAt the end of the day, we enjoyed dinner on our terrace.\nFinally, a local association offered an evening of stargazing near Mount Hum.\nDay 5: Arrival on the island of Korčula # Before leaving, we wanted to visit the bunkers. However, the road seemed forbidden, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t continue on foot.\nWe took our scheduled boat at lunchtime after a quick tour of the former military base, and then collected our car. Beware, it\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a walk from the ferry port to Vela Luka.\nView from the boat It takes about an hour by car to cross the island. We stopped off at our accommodation in Račišće and then headed off for a swim towards Lumbarda.\nOur accommodation meant we had to do quite a bit of driving each time.\nDay 6: Kayak # Our day was dedicated to a kayak trip. We rented a double kayak from Oreb Club International and sailed to the islands of Vrnik, Kamenjak, Planjak and Badija. Be careful, there are lots of sea urchins.\nWe ended the day with the Sword Dance show in Korcula.\nDay 7: Visit to Žitna and Pupnatska Luka # After buying some olive oil, we went for a swim in Žitna. The setting is very pleasant, even if a little crowded.\nView of Žitna We then went to Pupnatska Luka to finish the day. This place is a little more touristy than the previous one.\nDay 8: Visit to Vela Spila and return to Dubrovnik # Before catching the boat and returning our car, we visited the Vela Spila cave. This is a fairly small archaeological site. The entrance fee is low, so it\u0026rsquo;s still a good place to visit.\nTo make the most of Dubrovnik, we took the Dubrovnik pass, which includes public transport and visits to certain sites, including the city walls. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to visit the city walls or all the museums, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend this pass.\nDay 9: Tour of Dubrovnik\u0026rsquo;s Old Town and return to Paris # After dropping off our luggage, we headed for the city walls. We enjoyed the view of the sea and the old town. We also visited the various museums included in the pass.\nView from the ramparts We then enjoyed a final meal in the city before boarding our plane for Paris at the end of the day.\nBudget # Many shops do not accept payment cards. It is therefore important to bring cash with you. What\u0026rsquo;s more, most ATMs charge a fee of around €5.\nWe spent around €1,500 per person all-inclusive, including flights. This includes accommodation, food, activities, transport and other expenses (petrol, souvenirs, etc.).\nMusic # The car journeys were too noisy due to the air conditioning or open windows, so we didn\u0026rsquo;t listen to any music.\n","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/posts/2024-croatia/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Our trip in Croatia","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/roadtrip/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Roadtrip","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/van/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Van","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/climbing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Climbing","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"1 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/mountaineering/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mountaineering","type":"tags"},{"content":"Marc and I thought it might be fun to have another mountain outing. After a bit of research, we decided to head for the Canigou.\nWhat is the Pic du Canigou? # The Pic du Canigou, also known as the Pica del Canigó, is the highest peak in the eastern Pyrenees, reaching an altitude of 2,784 meters. It is located in the Canigou massif, in the Pyrénées-Orientales department of France.\nCanigou is a sacred mountain for Catalans, who consider it a symbol of their national identity. It is often mentioned in Catalan literature and music, and is a popular place of pilgrimage.\nClimbing Canigou is a challenging but rewarding trek. There are several itineraries, but the most popular starts at the refuge du Canigou, at around 1,600 meters altitude. The climb takes around 7 hours, and the panorama from the summit is breathtaking.\nGetting there # We set off mid-afternoon from the Casteil parking lot dedicated to accessing the Abbaye Saint-Martin du Canigou. We took the road leading to the abbey. It took us over 5 hours to reach the Arago refuge, which meant a lot of climbing through the forest.\nMarc in the climb to the refuge\nThe big day # We decided to climb to the summit of Canigou via the Quazemi ridge. The Quazemi ridge is a variant of the normal route to the Pic du Canigou. It offers a more adventurous and aesthetically pleasing route than the normal one, but is also more difficult and exposed.\nAfter a quick freeze-dried breakfast, we packed our bags and set off into the forest just above the refuge. The climb is long and there are no tracks. So we had to make our way through forest, snow and scree.\nMarc on the climb to Qazemi de Dalt\nOnce we\u0026rsquo;d reached the summit of Quazemi de Dalt, we unpacked our rucksacks and got into our gear.\nThe route of the ridge presented us with difficulties in two places. At the letterbox, we didn\u0026rsquo;t pass under the boulder, but went down to the right to climb up the other side, to the right of the piton. Marc took a nasty fall on his second descent. We should have simply abseiled. The second moment was on another de-escalation on a slab that we had to go around. Not being sure of the route, I first tried to join some ropes on the left, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem any easier. An abseil using the mobile link would have been easier.\nThe atmosphere was still very pleasant, and some of the passages were really good for climbing.\nAs for the weather, it was fine but very windy, which made it feel very cold.\nNicolas on top of Qazemi de Dalt\nThe descent # Just after reaching the summit of Canigou, we packed up our gear. We didn\u0026rsquo;t even take the time to take a photo. We identified the route for the descent and set off down the long couloir. It took us a long time to get to the refuge.\nWe took a break at the refuge to collect our things and have a snack. I was already very tired.\nIt still took us over 3 hours by headlamp to reach the car, which we reached around midnight. It had been a long day!\nThe view from Quazemi de Dalt\n","date":"1 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/posts/2023-canigou/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Quazemi ridge at the Canigou","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"1 December 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/travel/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Travel","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/camper/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Camper","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/iceland/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Iceland","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/islande/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Islande","type":"tags"},{"content":"My girlfriend and I decided to spend a week in Iceland this summer. For this first trip to the country, we chose to concentrate on the south, so as not to spread ourselves too thin.\nTo free ourselves from a lot of constraints, we decided to rent a van, so we could sleep wherever we wanted.\nPlease note: it\u0026rsquo;s forbidden to sleep anywhere in Iceland. You have to sleep in campsites, which are areas set aside for travelers. They can be found all over the country. The good news is that it\u0026rsquo;s generally not necessary to book a campsite in Iceland. All you have to do is settle in and pay at reception.\nVehicle # For our trip to Iceland, we opted for the smallest van offered by the company Kukucampers. It was a converted Dacia Dokker 2-wheel drive, which means it can\u0026rsquo;t take F roads.\nThe van was equipped with the essentials for cooking, eating and washing up: crockery, a gas stove, cooking utensils and cutlery. We also took comforters, pillows, a gas cartridge and a 10-liter water tank.\nWe regularly topped up the water tank at filling stations.\nThe van was well insulated enough to sleep well, although the temperature could drop considerably at night. It was still a bit chilly when we woke up, but we had our warm comforters.\nRoute # Day 1: Paris evening departure and arrival at Keflavik # Day 2: Arrival at the Snæfellsnes peninsula and night at Secret Campsite # After waiting far too long for the rental agency to open, we were finally able to do the paperwork and pick up our van after a briefing.\nDespite our early departure from the airport (8 a.m.), we didn\u0026rsquo;t hit the road until late morning, around 11 a.m., initially to do some shopping for the trip.\nWe continued on our way to the Snorrastadir Farm Holidays campsite. From there, we hiked up to the Eldbord crater.\nAt the end of the day, we took a break on the beach at Ytri Tunga to observe the seals, of which there were many.\nWe ended our day with a visit to the Lýsulaugar swimming pool, where we could relax in the warm water. We then slept at Secret Campsite, a rather rustic but charming campsite: there are no showers, and you have to pay cash!\nI fell asleep safely after a rather high number of sleepless hours for me.\nDay 3: Peninsula visit and night in Vatnskot # We began our day with a visit to the Lóndrangar cliffs, a magnificent cliff landscape, before setting off to climb the Saxhóll volcano. The climb takes just ten minutes from the parking lot and offers a breathtaking view of the region.\nWe stopped off at Svöðufoss. This waterfall, near Rif, is remarkable for its pyramidal shape. We were able to admire it up close, from a path that leads to the foot of the waterfall. There is also a path leading up to the top.\nAfter a lunch break at the Reks restaurant in Ólafsvik, we continued on to the Kirkjufellsfoss waterfall. Unfortunately, it was very busy with tourists. Nevertheless, we stopped to admire it.\nNext, we attempted to climb Mount Kirkjufell, a 463-metre-high mountain that served as the backdrop for the Game of Thrones series. We stopped at the first rope (there are three in all) to avoid taking any risks. We didn\u0026rsquo;t come across any groups of hikers who had reached the summit.\nWe ended the day by settling into the Vatnskot camp. This has a common room for cooking and eating, as well as toilets. Showers are at the main camp.\nIt was a long day and we arrived at camp very late. On the way, we booked the first snorkeling slot in the Silfra Fault the following morning.\nDay 4: Snorkeling, geysers and waterfall # After an early wake-up call, we make our way to the rendezvous point for our morning activity: snorkeling in the Silfra fissure, a normal fault between the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates. This fault is underwater, which is between 2 and 4°C.\nFor this activity, we went through Dive.is.\nWe equip ourselves with thermal underwear, a thermal under-suit and a fully waterproof wetsuit. To this we add gloves and a balaclava. Only our hands and face will get wet during the dive.\nVisibility is excellent, we can see up to 100 meters. It\u0026rsquo;s quite majestic. We marvel at the beauty of the fault, which is lined with volcanic rock. We stay in the water for about 40 minutes, enjoying the moment.\nBack at the main camp, we enjoy a hot shower and prepare a meal.\nIn the late afternoon, we head east. We stop at the Brúarárfoss waterfall, set in a narrow gorge. We are then impressed by the Geysir geysers, including Strokkur, which erupts every 5 to 8 minutes.\nWe settle in at the Skjól campsite, where we meet up with two Frenchwomen we had met at the airport. We spend a pleasant evening in their company.\nDay 5: Waterfalls and lagoon # When we wake up, we head for Gullfoss, one of Iceland\u0026rsquo;s largest waterfalls.\nThe view is breathtaking. We take in the view despite the rain, then head for the Secret Lagoon.\nThe Secret Lagoon is a natural hot-water pool set in a lava field. We arrive just before noon, and the place is already busy. We undressed and plunged into the warm, relaxing water.\nOverall, we preferred our small pool on Day 2. Indeed, the small pool on day 2 was quieter and more intimate. But the Secret Lagoon is a unique experience in Iceland.\nWe set off again for the Seljalandsfoss waterfall. Seljalandsfoss is a 60-metre-high waterfall. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to walk behind the waterfall, which gives you a breathtaking view of the torrent of water. You\u0026rsquo;ll come out pretty wet, but it\u0026rsquo;s magnificent.\nWe then walk for a few minutes to reach Gljúfrabúi waterfall. Gljúfrabúi is a waterfall hidden in a cave. To reach it, you have to walk a few meters through a narrow canyon.\nThe waterfall is even more impressive than Seljalandsfoss. We marvel at the beauty of this natural landscape.\nAfter a short drive, we reach the Skógafoss waterfall. Skógafoss is a 60-metre-high waterfall. We climb the stairs to reach the top, from where we have a breathtaking view of the waterfall and the valley. Other waterfalls can be seen further up the path, but we didn\u0026rsquo;t stay long.\nWe finally reach the Vik campsite and take a stroll along the beach to end the day. Vik\u0026rsquo;s beach is black sand, bordered by steep cliffs. We stroll along the beach, admiring the sunset over the ocean.\nIt was an emotional day. We were lucky enough to discover some magnificent landscapes, and had an unforgettable time in Iceland.\nDay 6: Glacier and Diamond beach # In my opinion, it was the most impressive day of the year.\nLeaving Vik, we stopped off at Gígjagjá Cave, also known as \u0026ldquo;Yoda\u0026rsquo;s Cave\u0026rdquo;. Gígjagjá Cave is a natural formation created by a volcanic eruption. It is 200 metres long and 20 meters wide. Yoda\u0026rsquo;s silhouette appears when you look out from inside the cave, as the shape of the rock is reminiscent of the famous Star Wars character.\nOur next stop was the Skaftafell glacier. The Skaftafell glacier is Iceland\u0026rsquo;s largest glacier after Vatnajökull. It covers an area of 700 square kilometers. We parked the car at the Skaftafell parking lot, and followed a path to Lake Jökulsárlón.\nA path along the left-hand side leads to the glacier and upwards. Caution: the path is exposed to falling rocks. So don\u0026rsquo;t linger on it. What\u0026rsquo;s more, glacier trekking requires proper equipment and knowledge of the risks if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to end up drowned or frozen.\nWe then set off again for Diamond Beach. Diamond Beach is located on the south coast of Iceland. It\u0026rsquo;s famous for the icebergs that wash ashore. We were amazed by the beauty of this beach.\nThe icebergs come in all sizes, and some are enormous. We spent a long time admiring them.\nWe ended the day closer to the terminal of our boat for the following day, stopping off at the Skógafoss campsite where we\u0026rsquo;d been the day before. We were tired, but delighted to have experienced this unforgettable day.\nDay 7: Vestmannaeyjar # We woke up bright and early to catch the second boat to the island of Vestmannaeyjar (boat departs at 10:45). The journey takes about 45 minutes, and we decided to go without a car.\nOnce on the island, we started walking towards the shearwater observation point. The wind was strong, and we moved slowly. After more than an hour and a half\u0026rsquo;s walk, we decided to hitch a ride back to the observation point.\nWe reached the Stórhöfði lighthouse, then headed back down to the observation point. We saw a few shearwaters, but expected to see a lot more.\nWe then began the descent to the town center, also by hitchhiking. We then walked over the old lava flows of Eldfell, the volcano that was born in 1973.\nAfter this last walk, we took the boat back to Þorlákshöfn.\nWe slowly make our way back to the Þorlákshöfn campsite.\nDay 8: Last walk and departure # On our last day, we set off on a twenty-kilometer hike. The aim is to reach the lava flow from the eruption of the Fagradalsfjall volcano, which began in December 2021 and ended in March 2023.\nThe trail is relatively flat and well-marked. It first passes the lava flows of the previous year, which stretch for several kilometers. Parts of these flows are still smoldering and can give off dangerous gases.\nAfter a few more kilometers, we reach the 2023 lava flow. It\u0026rsquo;s still very steaming and the temperature is high. However, we can touch the stones at the edge, which are not particularly hot.\nThe thickness of the lava is impressive. It reaches several meters in height. We stay a while to observe this grandiose natural spectacle. But there\u0026rsquo;s no more molten lava.\nAfter the hike, we head back west to the Blue Lagoon. This artificial lagoon is located next to a large geothermal power station. It\u0026rsquo;s fed by the power plant\u0026rsquo;s hot water, which has a temperature of over 100 degrees Celsius.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t go for a swim, but admire the place, which isn\u0026rsquo;t as full as we\u0026rsquo;d hoped.\nFinally, we make a last tour of the Reykjanesskagi peninsula, taking in the magnificent scenery for a final meal before heading back to Keflavík airport.\nBudget # We were able to pay (almost, except for the Secret Campsite) for all our purchases, including accommodation, activities and meals, by card without any problems. So there\u0026rsquo;s no need to bring cash.\nWe spent around €1,100 per person all-inclusive, not including flights. This includes accommodation, food, activities, transport and other expenses (petrol, souvenirs, etc.).\nMusic # During this trip, we mainly listened to the following songs (a bit on a loop\u0026hellip;):\nMon Paradis, Fils Cara y\u0026rsquo;a rien de plus chiant que la joie, Nikola Le stade, Fredz Comme un idiot, Le trottoir ","date":"25 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/posts/2023-iceland/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Our roadtrip in Iceland","type":"posts"},{"content":"At the end of May, we spent a week climbing in the Tarn and Jonte gorges.

It takes about 25 minutes to walk from the Bures-sur-Yvette train station.\nThe viaduct has 12 arches and reaches a height of 34 meters. The pillars can be climbed on all sides.\nFauvettes viaduct, photo by Lionel Allorge A PDF topo is available here. An up-to-date paper version is also available from CoSiRoc.

It is accessible by public transport from the Saint-Maximim train station.\nThe site is well known to climbing clubs in the region, as it is a school cliff and therefore ideal for beginners. It\u0026rsquo;s also easy to get an overview, especially for supervising a group.\nSaint-Maximim, photo by toeg under licence CC by-sa This former limestone quarry has been converted for climbing.

We had a beer (after the climb, of course) and he told me about his plans to climb the Aiguille Dibona. We had a good feeling about it, but hadn\u0026rsquo;t had the chance to climb together again.\nWhat is the Dibona needle? # I\u0026rsquo;m going to paraphrase Wikipedia a little, but this is a granite needle culminating at 3131 meters in the Soreiller massif in the Ecrins. It really does have a distinctive shape, and the refuge (refuge du Soreiller) just below it makes it very accessible for climbers. All this makes it a very popular and famous spot for climbers.\nNext to the refuge, at the foot of the Aiguille and after a successful ascent The genesis of the project # This summer, I had the opportunity to climb with this person again, and it was when he told me about the Dibona that I thought \u0026ldquo;but we\u0026rsquo;ve climbed together before, haven\u0026rsquo;t we?\u0026rdquo;. Then, a few weeks later, he wrote again, saying \u0026ldquo;September 11 weekend, hot for the Dibona?\nThat was all it took to motivate me. The aim was to achieve the Obligatory Visit by following the CampToCamp topo here. It\u0026rsquo;s a classic in the sector, 12 pitches for around 370m of difficulty, mainly in the 6a range.\nAfter many days watching the weather forecasts, I decided to take my train tickets despite the persistent uncertainties. Departure from Paris on Friday lunchtime and return Sunday evening, leaving little opportunity if conditions weren\u0026rsquo;t perfect.\nWe did, however, have a look at the surrounding spots to serve as plan B.\nThe outward journey # When Friday arrived, we called the refuge to ask about the conditions (very good according to the warden), confirm our reservation for that evening and possibly get a reservation for Saturday night. The latter was not possible, as the refuge was always full.\nIn terms of timing, our only option was to climb the Dibona on Saturday. A Sunday ascent would not have allowed me to get back to Paris in time.\nWe arrived at the parking lot in the hamlet of Les Etages at around 8pm. We decided to leave the tent and food in the car and head straight back down to the parking lot after the climb. The aim of this solution was to lighten our packs as much as possible so that we would be less tired on the ascent.\nThe other solution was to take the tent, comforters, etc. with us, so that we could bivouac around the refuge for the night from Saturday to Sunday.\nThe first stage was the climb to the refuge by headlamp. About 1300 meters of ascent in 2h10. A bit tricky for me, much less so for my climbing companion. We arrived at the refuge in our teeshirts and sweating despite the night.\nWe chat a bit with a few climbers eating in the common room before going to bed.\nAt the top of aiguille Dibona The big day # On Saturday morning, after a well-deserved breakfast, we set about preparing our gear and packs. In order to lighten the load on the leader (we\u0026rsquo;ll be climbing with a reversible), we decide to share a doc bag, which we exchange at the belay station.\nWe reached the bottom of the route without difficulty, but hesitated about the spit line. After consulting the various topos we\u0026rsquo;d taken photos of, we opted for the ones furthest to the left. My climbing partner starts first.\nThe pitches follow one another in different styles, including a lot of slab. We were alone on the route, but a rope from another route joined us at the end. Some of the pitches are impressive. My favorites were pitches 8 for the pretty yellow scales and 12 for the ridge traverse with no real protection. The climb to the summit is magnificent and easy, but you mustn\u0026rsquo;t zip.\nThe descent # The descent is a single abseil (okay with a 2x50m), followed by a short traverse and a path back down to the refuge. Be careful to follow the kerns and not to descend too far (which we didn\u0026rsquo;t, of course\u0026hellip;).\nWe join the refuge for a snack and they tell us that places have opened up and we can sleep here tonight.\nAfter a (poor) night\u0026rsquo;s sleep, we enjoy the scenery one last time and start our descent.\n","date":"18 September 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/posts/2023-vo-dibona/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Visite Obligatoire at the Dibona","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 April 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/internet/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Internet","type":"tags"},{"content":"My very first node was an OVH cloud server (the cheapest in the range) hosted in Strasbourg.\nIn order to test the internal routing, I looked for ways to have several additional nodes.

The main difference is that it is mainly built on VPN tunnels rather than physical links (cables or fibers between different locations/operators).\nIt therefore uses the (traditional) Internet to establish VPN tunnels. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s called an overlay network.\nThe first step is to create a number of administrative objects:\nmntner ; person. The second step is to request resources. Rather than requesting, it\u0026rsquo;s more a question of allocating resources that are still free.\nFor my part, I\u0026rsquo;ve requested :\nan ASN (4242422575) ; an ipv4 prefix (172.23.186.32/27) ; an ipv6 prefix (fd45:1b93:dddf::/48) ; a domain name (androw.dn42). The final step is to create route objects to declare that your ASN has the right to advertise your prefixes. Indeed, on dn42, many networks implement ROAs to check that these elements exist. This prevents anyone else from announcing your prefixes.\nThese three steps are very well presented on the wiki: Getting-Started\nUnlike the Internet, most people here use ipv6. There are even a number of networks that only support ipv6.\nOnce our objects have been created/assigned, we need to start using them. To do this, you\u0026rsquo;ll need a router that knows how to speak BGP: either a hardware router (Cisco, etc\u0026hellip;) or a simple server that could play this role. BGP is the protocol used on dn42 (and on the Internet) to exchange routes between AS.\nFor my part, my first router was an OVH cloud server (which unfortunately perished in the Strasbourg fire). I decided to install bird2 to talk to my peers.\nThe wiki shows a simple configuration that works without a hitch: Bird2. It also presents the configuration to be used for certain routers or other BGP daemons.\nOnce all this has been configured, you need to find your first peers, i.e. your first neighbor with whom you\u0026rsquo;re going to exchange routes and therefore traffic. To do this, go to the peerfinder: https://dn42.us/peers/\nBased on your public ipv4/ipv6 address, this tool will send you a list of routers that have a low ping with your server, and with whom it is then more optimal to peer. It also indicates the way to contact this peer, usually an IRC nickname or a site with the necessary information.\nFor my part, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to opt solely for peering through Wireguard tunnels, for simplicity\u0026rsquo;s sake. Here again, the wiki is a great help: wireguard\nYou then need to provide all the information to your peer. You can find an example of the necessary information on ./net/.\nThe Networksettings page provides information on the options that need to be enabled for everything to work properly. It is also necessary to adapt iptables rules so that packets can be transferred between the various interfaces relating to dn42.\n","date":"9 April 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/posts/2023-arrival-dn42/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My arrival on dn42","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"6 September 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/lomography/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Lomography","type":"tags"},{"content":"Some random pictures I\u0026rsquo;ve taken on my trip (Aix-en-Provence, Chamonix, etc\u0026hellip;).\n","date":"6 September 2020","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/posts/2023-random-pictures/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Random pictures","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"18 September 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/amf/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Amf","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 September 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/data/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Data","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 September 2019","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-86/en/tags/finance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Finance","type":"tags"},{"content":"Update (12/04/2020): Following a modification to the AMF website, my scraping script no longer works.

They offered two formulas for the climb:\n3 days preparation, two days for the ascent ; 2 days preparation, three days climbing. The advantage of the latter was that it offered a wider window of opportunity to attempt the summit. So we opted for August 6 to 10.\nAfter a bit of shopping (well, a lot), we headed off the weekend before the course to enjoy the mountains around Les Houches.\nFrom La Côte, we climbed up to Col de Voza and then back down via Vaudagne. This little jaunt through the mountain pastures was already quite a change of scenery for us Parisians. We also climbed to the Aiguillette des Houches, the Pointe de Lapaz and then descended via the Col de Bel Lachat (in the rain, incidentally).\nOn the morning of August 6, we arrived at the meeting point: the parking lot at Les Houches.\nWe met our guide (Bruno Mazier) and the other two members of our group. We borrowed the equipment we needed (boots, crampons, ice axe) and then drove to Le Tour, where we took the gondola. After a short walk, we arrived at the Albert 1er refuge.\nWe took advantage of the afternoon to learn how to walk on the Tour glacier, roped up with crampons, \u0026ldquo;climb\u0026rdquo; a small ice wall, etc\u0026hellip;\nThe next day, we climbed up to Tête Blanche.
